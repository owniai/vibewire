# CONTEXT.md Format

Path: `.vibewire/CONTEXT.md`

## Structure

```md
# {Context Name}

{One or two sentence description of what this context is and why it exists.}

## Language

**Order**:
{A one or two sentence description of the term}
_Avoid_: Purchase, transaction

**Invoice**:
A request for payment sent to a customer after delivery.
_Avoid_: Bill, payment request
```

Optional sections when useful: `## Relationships`, `## Flagged ambiguities`.

## Rules

- **Be opinionated.** When multiple words exist for the same concept, pick the best one and list the others under `_Avoid_`.
- **Keep definitions tight.** One or two sentences max. Define what it IS, not what it does.
- **Only include terms specific to this project's context.** General programming concepts don't belong. Ask: is this unique to this domain, or a general programming concept? Only the former belongs.
- **Group terms under subheadings** when natural clusters emerge; otherwise a flat list is fine.

## Multi-context (rare)

If needed, `.vibewire/CONTEXT-MAP.md` can list multiple context files under `.vibewire/`. Most projects use a single `.vibewire/CONTEXT.md`. Create the map only when multiple bounded contexts are real and confirmed.
